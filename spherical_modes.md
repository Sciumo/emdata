# Spherical Modes

Spherical modes are a valid way to represent far-field data. Spherical modes are discussed in depth in [Richie and Johnson's IEEE paper][1]. See [Wikipedia][2] for additional details.

Because spherical mode representation doesn't use spatial sampling, it doesn't slide nicely into a coordinate-vector-phasor representation. However, the flexible nature of [emdata][3] allows us to represent spherical modes.

A fully-defined set of spherical mode data must include _TBD_. These are defined in the emdata file as:
* _TBD_
